## User Story

As a user, I want to use wildcard syntax when searching for characters, so that I can have more flexible search queries.

## Background and Context

The character search inputs across the application (e.g. generation page, character addition modal) need to instruct or support the user in making wildcard queries. This might just be integrating with the updated backend endpoint or allowing special characters.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a character search input, when the user types a partial string, then the UI fetches and displays partial matches smoothly.
2. Given a character search input, when the user provides wildcard characters (if required by backend), then the UI handles them correctly or appends them behind the scenes.

## DDD References

- Bounded Context: Presentation.

## Out of Scope

- Advanced query building logic.

## Open Questions

- Does the backend require explicit wildcard notation?

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria are verified by a stakeholder or QA.
- [x] The feature behaves consistently across affected platform parts.
- [x] Relevant documentation or user-facing content is updated.
- [x] Ticket status updated to `done`.
