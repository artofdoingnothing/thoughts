# Random Movie Characters Feature Tickets

This file serves as an index for the multi-file task related to fetching and displaying random movie characters.

## Tickets

1. **Backend**: `20260223_191226_backend_random_movie_characters.md`
   - Covers the implementation of the backend endpoint to fetch 50 random movie characters seeded by a timestamp.
2. **Frontend**: `20260223_191226_frontend_random_movie_characters.md`
   - Covers the implementation of the random character fetching logic, table format with a plus icon, and vertically expanding selected list UI components.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. Implement the backend ticket first (`STORY-1`) to ensure the data API is available and predictable.
2. Implement the frontend ticket (`STORY-2`), integrating the newly created backend API.
