## User Story

As a user, I want to search for movie characters using partial name matches, so that I can easily find characters even if I only remember part of their name.

## Background and Context

The Movie Dataset Service currently provides character lookup capabilities. This needs to be enhanced to support wildcard or substring searching on the character's name to improve discoverability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a search query with a partial character name, when the search is executed, then the system returns all characters whose names contain that substring.
2. Given a search query with multiple wildcards, when the search is executed, then the system handles it gracefully and returns matching results.

## DDD References

- Bounded Context: AI Processing (or Integration layer for Dataset Services).

## Out of Scope

- Full-text search across movie scripts.

## Open Questions

- Is case-insensitivity required? (Assumption: Yes).

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria are verified by a stakeholder or QA.
- [x] The feature behaves consistently across affected platform parts.
- [x] Relevant documentation or user-facing content is updated.
- [x] Ticket status updated to `done`.
